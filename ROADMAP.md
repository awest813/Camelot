- ✅ Stealth system (vision cone, hearing radius, detection meter, crouch).
- ✅ Crime system (per-faction bounties, witness logic, guard challenges).
- ✅ Container/loot system (chests, corpses, lockpicking difficulty).
- ✅ Barter system (buy/sell pricing tied to skill, merchant open/close hours).
- ✅ Projectile system (bow and arrow with archery skill, quiver management).
- ✅ Cell/interior transition system (portals, interior cells, visited-cell tracking).
- ✅ Time system (game clock, day/night cycle, ambient intensity).
- ✅ **SpellSystem** — Known-spell pool, equip/cast, cooldowns, destruction/restoration schools (Q to cast, Z to cycle).
- ✅ **PersuasionSystem** — Per-NPC disposition, persuasion checks, merchant price multipliers.
- ✅ **LootTableSystem** — Data-driven weighted loot generation with starter tables; overhauled with conditional entries (`minLevel`/`maxLevel`/`requiredFlags`), guaranteed drops (`guarantee`), sub-table chaining (`subTableId`), and sparse-roll `noneWeight`; new `boss_loot` and `treasure_chest` tables; `rollTable()` / `rollTables()` accept `LootContext` for level-scaled loot.
- ✅ **GameEventBus** — Typed pub/sub event bus for all major gameplay events.
- ✅ **AlchemySystem** — Oblivion-style alchemy: ingredient satchel, effect discovery (eat/mix), potion crafting from 2–4 ingredients with shared-effect intersection, skill scaling, and save-state persistence. L to open workbench.
- ✅ **NPC archetype resistances/weaknesses** — `damageResistances` and `damageWeaknesses` fields added to `NpcArchetypeDefinition`; data-driven per-archetype damage modifiers applied on spawn (bandit chief: physical resist, mage apprentice: elemental resist/physical weak, etc.).
- ✅ **EnchantingSystem** — Oblivion-style enchanting: five soul gem tiers (petty → grand) scale effect magnitude; 10 enchantment effects across weapon (fire/frost/shock damage, absorb health, drain magicka) and armor (fortify health/magicka/stamina/strength, resist damage) categories; enchanting skill (0–100) further scales magnitude; items are renamed on enchant and stats applied immediately; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 8). B to open altar.
- ✅ **WeatherSystem** — Markov-chain atmospheric weather (Clear/Overcast/Foggy/Rain/Storm); smooth fog-density/fog-colour/ambient-light transitions; `forceWeather()` for scripted events; onWeatherChange callback wired to EventBus; weather label in debug overlay (F3); save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 9).
- ✅ **QuickSlotSystem** — Bind consumable items (health/magicka/stamina potions) to hotkeys 7/8/9/0; effects applied directly to player stats; removes one item per use; `onItemConsumed` callback wired to EventBus; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 9).
- ✅ **WaitSystem** — Oblivion-style wait/rest (T key): choose 1–24 in-game hours, clock advances instantly, Health/Magicka/Stamina restore proportionally (full rest at 24 h); save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 10).
- ✅ **Compass HUD** — Top-center compass strip shows three cardinal labels (e.g. NW · N · NE) that scroll as the player turns; updates every frame from camera yaw with zero runtime cost.
- ✅ **SkillProgressionSystem** — Oblivion-style use-based skill leveling (Blade, Destruction, Restoration, Marksman, Sneak, Speechcraft, Alchemy); XP gained from performing actions; `onSkillLevelUp` callback fires skill-up notifications; `multiplier(skill)` returns [1.0–2.0] bonus for other systems; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 11).
- ✅ **FastTravelSystem** — Discover named locations by visiting them; Y key shows discovered locations; `fastTravelTo()` teleports the player instantly (blocked in combat or while sneaking); auto-discovers cell transitions via `cellManager.onCellChanged`; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 11).
- ✅ **LevelScalingSystem** — Oblivion-style enemy scaling: NPC health, and XP reward scale with the player's current level (factor = 0.8 + level × 0.1, capped at 3×); applied on NPC spawn; structure NPCs also scaled via `world.structures.onNPCSpawn`.
- ✅ **FameSystem** — Oblivion-style fame and infamy tracking (0–1000 each); fame gained from quest completions, infamy from crimes; `dispositionModifier` in [−20, +20] affects NPC reactions and future persuasion/barter; tier labels (Unknown → Legendary Hero / Clean → Most Wanted); H key shows current reputation; `onFameChange` callback wired to EventBus; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 12).
- ✅ **ActiveEffectsSystem** — Tracks all time-limited effects from spells, potions, and enchantments; 12 effect types (health/magicka/stamina restore, fortify stats, resist damage, fire/frost/shock DoT, silence, burden); `update(dt, player)` applies per-second tick and expires finished effects; `onEffectExpired` fires worn-off notifications; infinite-duration enchantment auras supported; H key shows active effect names; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 12).
- ✅ **JailSystem** — Completes the crime loop: when a guard challenges a player who cannot pay the bounty, `serveJailTime()` converts gold bounty into in-game hours (1 h per 10 g, cap 72 h), advances the clock via TimeSystem, penalises skill levels via SkillProgressionSystem (Blade/Marksman/Sneak/Alchemy/Speechcraft/Destruction/Restoration), and clears all bounties; jail records persisted (SAVE_VERSION 12).
- ✅ **SpellMakingSystem** — Oblivion-style Altar of Spellmaking: combine 1–2 effect components (damage/heal/restore/silence/burden) from any school to forge a named custom spell; gold cost scales with magnitude and duration (MIN 50 g → MAX 2000 g); forged spell is registered into SpellSystem and learned immediately; `onSpellForged` callback awards Destruction XP; X key triggers a demo forge; duplicate-name guard and insufficient-gold guard; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 13).
- ✅ **RespawnSystem** — Oblivion-style encounter zone respawning: register zones with a configurable game-hour window (default 72 h = 3 in-game days); `markCleared(zoneId, gameTime)` starts the countdown; `update(gameTime)` fires `onZoneRespawn` when the window elapses and resets the pending flag; multiple zones tracked simultaneously; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 13).
- ✅ **MerchantRestockSystem** — Timed merchant inventory and gold restocking: register merchant templates (inventory + gold snapshot); `update(gameTime, barterSystem)` resets the live BarterSystem merchant record when the interval elapses (default 72 h); advances the next-restock deadline across multiple elapsed cycles; `onRestock` callback fires a UI notification; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 13).
- ✅ **BirthsignSystem** — Oblivion's 13 birthsigns (Warrior, Mage, Thief, Lady, Lord, Steed, Ritual, Apprentice, Atronach, Shadow, Lover, Serpent, etc.) chosen once at character creation; each sign permanently boosts attributes or max stats, and most grant a once-per-24h rechargeable special power (Mara's Gift, Moonshadow, Lover's Kiss, Serpent's Spell, Blood of the North, …); `stunted` flag suppresses magicka regeneration for the Atronach; `fireWeakness` for the Lord; flat max-stat bonuses (maxMagicka +50/+100/+150) for Mage/Apprentice/Atronach; power cooldown tracked in in-game hours; `onBirthsignChosen` + `onPowerActivated` callbacks; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 14).
- ✅ **ClassSystem** — Oblivion-style character classes (Warrior, Knight, Barbarian, Mage, Sorcerer, Healer, Thief, Scout, Rogue, Battlemage); each class defines a specialization (combat/magic/stealth), two favored attributes (+10 each), five major skills (starting +25 levels, 1.5× XP), and five minor skills (starting +10 levels, 1.25× XP); specialization group grants +5 to all related skills; `xpMultiplierFor(skillId)` scales all in-game XP awards so major-skill users progress faster; `onClassChosen` callback syncs derived stats; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 14).
- ✅ **RaceSystem** (fully activated powers) — Oblivion-depth racial powers for all 10 races (Nord, Imperial, Breton, Redguard, High Elf, Dark Elf, Wood Elf, Orc, Khajiit, Argonian); each race now grants a genuine once-per-24h rechargeable power that dispatches real `ActiveEffect` entries (health/magicka/stamina restore, fortify strength, resist damage, etc.); `activatePower(gameTime, activeEffectsSystem)` dispatches all power effects, `canActivatePower()` enforces the cooldown, `powerCooldownRemaining()` reports minutes left; `onPowerActivated` callback fires HUD notification; V key activates the power in-game; power cooldown persisted (SAVE_VERSION 16).
- ✅ **PlayerLevelSystem** — Oblivion-style skill-based character leveling: accumulate 10 major-skill level-ups (as defined by the chosen ClassSystem) to trigger a character level-up; each attribute's bonus (+1 to +5) follows the Oblivion multiplier table (1–4 level-ups → +2, 5–7 → +3, 8–9 → +4, 10+ → +5) based on how many governing skills were leveled that character level; `confirmLevelUp(primary, sec1, sec2)` applies bonuses for three distinct chosen attributes and advances `characterLevel`; `suggestedAttributes` convenience property returns the three highest-bonus attributes for auto-apply; `onLevelUpReady` fires with the available bonuses when the threshold is reached; `onLevelUpComplete(newLevel)` fires after bonuses are applied; skill → attribute mapping mirrors Oblivion (blade → Strength, block → Endurance, destruction/restoration → Willpower, marksman → Agility, sneak → Speed, speechcraft → Luck, alchemy → Intelligence); attribute bonuses immediately sync `maxHealth`/`maxMagicka`/`maxStamina`/`maxCarryWeight`; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 17).

### World + Content

- ✅ Infinite chunk-based terrain.
- ✅ Biomes with procedural vegetation/props.
- ✅ Deterministic structures and loot opportunities.

### UX + Persistence

- ✅ HUD, quest log, inventory, skill tree, pause flow.
- ✅ Save/load (SAVE_VERSION 19) for all system states.
- ✅ Save file export to JSON file download + import from JSON/File (browser-safe).
- ✅ Notifications, hit feedback, and debug support.

- ✅ Racial Power (V key) — activate the chosen race's once-per-day power; HUD notification shows name + description; cooldown status message when on recharge.

---

## Alpha Stage Focus

The current alpha stage is centered on combat readability and encounter stability while preserving rapid iteration velocity.

### Alpha Milestones

- ✅ Multi-NPC threat handoff and attack-slot arbitration.
- ✅ NPC combat decision loops (distance bands, cooldown discipline).
- ✅ Expanded patrol variation and reactive state transitions.

## Near-Term (Next 1–2 Releases)

### Content Creation GUI Roadmap

To make content creation accessible to non-programmer designers, Camelot will
add a dedicated GUI layer on top of the existing framework + map editor data
model.

#### Release A — Authoring UX Foundations

- ✅ Dockable editor layout (Scene/Hierarchy/Inspector/Validation panes).
- ✅ Unified selection model shared by map entities, quest nodes, and dialogue nodes.
- ✅ Undo/redo history with grouped actions for transform + property edits (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z).
- ✅ Context-aware hotkey/help overlay so editor workflows are discoverable in-app (F1 toggles gameplay/editor key cheat sheet).

#### Release B — Content-Specific Editors

- ✅ **Quest Graph GUI**: node canvas for objectives, dependencies, fail states, and rewards — `QuestCreatorNodeDraft` now carries `x`/`y` canvas positions (auto-assigned in a 4-column grid); `QuestCreatorUI` renders an SVG graph panel below the node list showing prerequisite arrows between nodes.
- ✅ **Dialogue Tree GUI**: branching conversation editor with condition/effect forms — `DialogueCreatorUI` exposes per-choice condition (`flag`, `faction_min`, `quest_status`, `has_item`, `skill_min`) and effect (`set_flag`, `faction_delta`, `emit_event`, `activate_quest`, `consume_item`, `give_item`) editors in an expandable details panel alongside node text/speaker fields.
- ✅ **Loot + Spawn GUI**: weighted table editor, archetype picker, and spawn validation hints — `SpawnCreatorSystem` (headless CRUD + validate + export/import) and `SpawnCreatorUI` HTML overlay; archetype picker dropdown (guard/merchant/enemy/boss/…) + free-text custom ID; loot table ID link; count, level range, respawn interval; inline per-entry validation hints; wired as `Shift+F11` and added to the F11 Editor Hub grid.
- ✅ **Shared property inspectors** generated from schema metadata — `SchemaFieldBuilder` utility class (`src/ui/schema-field-builder.ts`) generates consistently styled `text`, `number`, `checkbox`, `select`, and `textarea` controls from a lightweight descriptor; used by `SpawnCreatorUI` to eliminate per-field boilerplate.

#### Release C — Validation + Packaging Workflow

- ✅ **Pre-publish validation dashboard** — `ContentBundleUI` (HTML overlay, Shift+F7 / Editor Hub "bundle") aggregates per-system diagnostics from all attached creator systems (map, quest, dialogue, faction, loot table, NPC, item, spawn) in a single scrollable dashboard with per-system pass/fail rows and expandable issue lists.
- ✅ **One-click content bundle export** — `ContentBundleSystem.exportToFile()` writes a single `.bundle.json` file containing the manifest and all attached system payloads; `buildBundle()` returns the structured object for programmatic use.
- ✅ **Diff-friendly JSON normalization** — `sortKeysDeep()` / `toNormalizedJson()` utilities recursively sort all object keys alphabetically so exported bundle JSON is stable and produces clean diffs regardless of authoring order.
- ✅ **"Play from here" test harness launchers** — each system row in `ContentBundleUI` has an "▶ Open" button that closes the dashboard and fires `onPlayFromHere(systemId)` so the game layer immediately opens the matching creator UI (quest, dialogue, faction, loot table, NPC, item, spawn, or map editor) for rapid content iteration.

#### Release D — Collaboration + Scale

- ✅ **Asset Browser** (`AssetBrowserSystem` + `AssetBrowserUI`, Shift+F6 / Editor Hub "🗂 Asset Browser") — searchable asset registry with type + tag filters and favorites; `importFromBundle()` bulk-registers all assets from a `.bundle.json`; per-asset detail panel shows description, tags, dependency graph (forward + reverse BFS), and an "Insert" callback for active-editor integration.
- ✅ **Bundle Merge Assistant** (`BundleMergeSystem` + `BundleMergeUI`, Shift+F5 / Editor Hub "🔀 Bundle Merge") — load two `.bundle.json` files, auto-detect conflicting content IDs across all systems and map entities, choose per-conflict resolution strategy (`keep-base` / `keep-incoming` / `rename-incoming`), bulk-apply a strategy with one click, then export the merged bundle as a diff-friendly JSON download.
- 🧭 Layer/stream controls for large worlds (region visibility, lock/hide, author ownership).
- 🧭 Optional cloud-backed publishing target compatible with local offline workflow.

---

## Next Steps

### Content GUI — Release D Remainder ✅

All planned Release D remainder items delivered:

1. ✅ **Layer author-ownership controls** — `owner?: string` added to `EditorLayer`; `MapEditorSystem.currentAuthor` + `setLayerOwner()` method; foreign-author layers auto-locked on `importMap()` when both `currentAuthor` and `layer.owner` are set and differ; `MapEditorLayerPanel` shows owner sub-row per layer (amber text + 🔐 icon for foreign layers, muted for own).

2. ✅ **Asset Browser enhancements** — Inline tag editor in detail panel (removable chips + add-tag input + "Add" button; changes committed live to registry); "⬇ Export Selected" button writes the selected asset + all transitive dependencies as `{id}_export.assets.json`; `EditorHubUI.setBadge(toolId, count)` updates a numeric badge on any tool card — wired on bundle import to show live asset count on the "🗂 Asset Browser" card.

3. ✅ **LocalStorage workspace draft** (`WorkspaceDraftSystem`, 20 tests) — `markDirty()` debounces a 2 s auto-save across all 8 creator systems; `restore()` reloads all stored system states on next session with a "Draft restored" HUD notification; `hasDraft()` / `clearDraft()` / `peekDraft()` / `getDraftSavedAt()` for programmatic control; `onSaved` callback shows a "Workspace draft auto-saved" notification after each auto-save; `markDirty()` wired to every creator UI `onClose`.

---

---

## Next Steps

### Content GUI — Release E (World-Scale Editing) ✅

All three Release E items delivered:

1. ✅ **Region-based streaming controls** — `RegionSystem` (`src/systems/region-system.ts`, 39 tests) partitions the map into named rectangular or spherical regions; per-region `setVisible()` / `setActive()` toggles with callbacks; `getRegionsAtPoint()` spatial query; `getActiveRegionIds()` / `getInactiveRegionIds()` helpers for LOD and AI integration; `getSnapshot()` / `restoreSnapshot()` for persistence; `attachLodSystem()` hook for future mesh-level LOD bypass.

2. ✅ **CLI / dev tooling** — `tools/validate-bundle.mjs` accepts a `.bundle.json` path, validates manifest schema, cross-checks declared vs. present systems, and performs per-system structural validation (quest node ids, dialogue nextNodeId refs, faction threshold ordering, loot entry integrity, etc.); exits non-zero on errors; suitable for CI pipelines and pre-commit hooks.

3. ✅ **Automated regression coverage** — Quest-and-inventory integration test suite (`src/framework/quest-inventory.integration.test.ts`, 45 tests) covering: item-consume effects via dialogue, give-item effects, fetch-quest pick-up flows with progress capping, multi-objective chain ordering with prerequisites, parallel start-node objectives, faction-disposition gating on dialogue choices, quest lifecycle guards (no re-activation after completion), save/restore round-trip preserving quest progress and inventory state, flag-gated dialogue choices, quest-status-gated dialogue choices, has_item-gated dialogue choices, concurrent multi-quest tracking, and save/restore preserving flags + faction reputation.

---

### Content GUI — Release G (Stability and Tooling) ✅

Both planned Stability and Tooling items delivered:

1. ✅ **Save migration/versioning workflow** — `SaveMigrationRegistry` (`src/framework/save/save-migration-registry.ts`, 21 tests) provides a structured, composable API for managing versioned save migrations: `register(fromVersion, migration)` for fluent step registration; `validate(minVersion, targetVersion)` to verify chain completeness with no gaps; `buildChain(minVersion, targetVersion)` to retrieve the ordered migration list (throws on missing steps); `apply(input, targetVersion?)` to drive `applySaveMigrations` from the registry's own entries; and `SaveMigrationRegistry.withDefaults()` factory pre-seeded with the built-in v0→v1 migration for easy extension. Exported from the framework public API (`src/framework/index.ts`).

2. ✅ **Expanded quest + inventory regression coverage** — Quest-and-inventory integration test suite extended from 27 to 45 tests adding: flag-gated dialogue choices (`set_flag` / `type: "flag"` conditions), quest-status-gated dialogue choices (`type: "quest_status"` for inactive/active/completed branching), `has_item`-gated dialogue choices with item-swap effects, concurrent multi-quest tracking (events attributed correctly, independent completion), and save/restore round-trips verifying flags, faction reputation, completed quest status, inventory contents, and full `exportSave`/`importSave` checksum cycle.

---

### Framework-First Consolidation

- 🧭 Expand framework runtime adapters so demo gameplay systems consume framework state as source-of-truth.
- ✅ Add richer dialogue effect hooks (quest activation, inventory consume/give, conditional branches by faction tiers).
- ✅ Add quest authoring utilities and graph validation diagnostics (dead-end node detection, cycle hints) with in-game validation hotkey (F8).
- ✅ Harden save migrations with versioned schema (SAVE_VERSION bumped on each structural change).
- 🧭 Add CLI/dev tooling for mod manifest generation and content schema validation.

### Oblivion-Lite Systems (v3)

- ✅ **GameEventBus** — Typed pub/sub event system wiring all major gameplay events.
- ✅ **SpellSystem** — Spell definitions, known-spell pool, equip/cast, cooldowns, damage/heal effects; Q to cast, Z to cycle.
- ✅ **LootTableSystem** — Data-driven weighted loot generation; overhauled with conditional entries, guaranteed drops, sub-table chaining, sparse-roll `noneWeight`, and `LootContext` for level-scaled loot; starter tables extended with `boss_loot` and `treasure_chest`.
- ✅ **PersuasionSystem** — Per-NPC disposition (0–100), persuasion checks with speechcraft skill, merchant price multipliers.
- ✅ **NpcArchetypeDefinition** — Data-driven NPC templates (guard, bandit, merchant, boss, innkeeper, villager) in content bundle.
- ✅ **Save file export/import** — Download save as JSON (`exportToFile`) and re-import via `importFromJson` / `importFromFile`.
- ✅ **SAVE_VERSION 6** — Spell and persuasion state persisted; backwards-incompatible saves are rejected cleanly.
- ✅ **SAVE_VERSION 7** — Alchemy state persisted.
- ✅ **SAVE_VERSION 8** — Enchanting system (soul gem inventory + enchanting skill) persisted; SAVE_VERSION_MIN = 5 constant fixes forward-compat boundary.
- ✅ **SAVE_VERSION 13** — SpellMakingSystem, RespawnSystem, and MerchantRestockSystem state persisted.
- ✅ **SAVE_VERSION 14** — BirthsignSystem and ClassSystem state persisted.
- ✅ **SAVE_VERSION 17** — PlayerLevelSystem (skill-based character level-up) state persisted.
- ✅ **SAVE_VERSION 18** — DailyScheduleSystem state persisted; `race` and `playerLevel` fields now correctly propagated through save validation.

### Character Progression Depth (Next)

- ✅ **Character Level-Up UI** — Dedicated level-up dialog (`LevelUpUI`) showing available attribute bonuses (+1 to +5) per attribute with governing-skill annotations, letting the player manually choose 3 attributes to increase; selection requires exactly 3 distinct attributes; confirm button enables only when 3 are chosen; triggered by `PlayerLevelSystem.onLevelUpReady`; modal (Escape blocked until confirmed); pointer lock and camera control restored on confirm; `onLevelUpComplete` notification fires after bonuses are applied.
- ✅ **DailyScheduleSystem** — NPC daily activity schedules (work, eat, sleep); `DailyScheduleSystem` wraps `ScheduleSystem` and connects it to `TimeSystem` via the `onHourChange` hook for fully automatic time-of-day NPC behaviour switching (no per-frame manual sync required); sleeping NPCs have their `mesh.metadata` cleared so they cannot be targeted for interaction or dialogue; metadata is restored on wake-up; `onNPCSleep` / `onNPCWake` callbacks fire HUD notifications; `isSleeping(name)` / `getActiveBehavior(npc)` query helpers; save-state persistence (SAVE_VERSION 18) re-derives sleep state from restored game time so the flag is never stale.
- ✅ **HorseSystem / Mount System** — Rideable horse companions; separate speed/stamina pool; dismount on combat; stable NPCs for purchase; horse inventory slot for saddlebags.



To make combat and interaction loops feel less mechanical, Camelot will follow a
three-step overhaul track:

1. ✅ **Input + interaction sanity pass**  
   - Block combat clicks while dialogue/UI overlays own focus.  
   - Prevent dialogue start against hostile NPCs.
2. ✅ **Combat cadence and recovery pacing**  
   - Add player attack cadence windows (melee/magic cooldown discipline).  
   - Add combat-aware regeneration delays after damage and resource spend.
3. ✅ **Follow-up readability + motion pass**  
   - Added clearer enemy telegraphs and dodge windows.  
   - Added NPC strafe/reposition variety and movement smoothing.  
   - Tuned stamina/magicka economy per weapon/spell archetype.

### AI and Encounter Quality

- ✅ Improve NPC combat decision loops (distance bands, cooldown discipline).
- ✅ Add better threat handoff (multi-NPC aggro arbitration).
- ✅ Expand patrol behaviors with idle variation and reactive states.
  - Randomised wait durations and look-around during patrol pauses.
  - New **INVESTIGATE** state: when a player escapes the ALERT window the NPC moves to the last known player position before resuming patrol, rather than immediately standing down.

### Combat Feel and Balance

- ✅ Add weapon archetype tuning passes (speed, stagger, resource cost).
- ✅ Add lightweight enemy resistances/weaknesses for build diversity — per-archetype damage modifiers in NpcArchetypeDefinition.
- ✅ Improve telegraph readability for enemy attacks.

### Stability and Tooling

- ✅ Improve save migration/versioning workflow.
- ✅ Add additional automated regression coverage for quests and inventory.

---

## Mid-Term (3–5 Releases)

### World Building Depth

- 🧭 Add additional biome-specific encounter tables.
- 🧭 Introduce landmark-driven exploration rewards.
- 🧭 Add environmental storytelling props and ambient events.

### Systems Expansion

- ✅ Alchemy/potion crafting prototype (AlchemySystem + AlchemyUI).
- ✅ Enchanting system (apply magical effects to weapons and armor) — soul gems, 10 enchantment types, skill scaling.
- ✅ Faction/reputation prototype tied to quests (FactionEngine + PersuasionSystem).
- 🧭 More advanced quest scripting hooks.

### Performance + Scalability

- ✅ **LodSystem** — Multi-level LOD with `registerLevels()`: supports high/medium/low detail mesh swapping based on player distance; previous binary visible/hidden culling preserved via `register()`; `update()` culled-count includes level-group hidden meshes; disposed-mesh pruning handles level groups; `unregisterLevels()` / `clear()` restore all LOD mesh visibilities.
- ✅ **ObjectPool\<T\>** — Generic reusable object pool eliminating GC-pressure allocation spikes for frequently created/destroyed game objects (loot meshes, projectiles, hit particles); `acquire()` / `release()` / `prewarm()` / `clear()`; `size` / `totalAllocated` accessors for profiling; configurable `maxSize` overflow disposal.
- 🧭 Optimize chunk streaming and object pooling.
- 🧭 Profile heavy combat scenes and UI redraw paths.

### Rendering + Visual Quality

- ✅ **GraphicsSystem** — Centralised, validated rendering configuration (no BabylonJS engine dependency): typed interfaces for `ShadowConfig` (power-of-two map size, blur kernel), `BloomConfig` (threshold, weight, kernel, scale), `PostProcessConfig` (FXAA, sharpen, ACES tone mapping, exposure, contrast, vignette), `SkyConfig` (turbidity, luminance, Rayleigh/Mie scattering, inclination, azimuth), `FogConfig` (density, colour), and `LightingConfig` (ambient + sun base intensities). `DEFAULT_*` presets document the in-game settings; `validate()` / `isValid` surface invalid values (non-power-of-two shadow maps, out-of-range bloom params, etc.) before they silently corrupt rendering. `game.ts` reads all configurable rendering values from `GraphicsSystem` instead of hardcoded magic numbers; sky-dome mesh, sky material, and `DefaultRenderingPipeline` are stored as `Game.skyDome`, `Game.skyMaterial`, and `Game.renderingPipeline` for lifecycle management; `_setLight()` now correctly private.

---

## Long-Term Vision

### Map Editor Initiative (Major Future Track)

Camelot will evolve toward a creator-friendly worldbuilding pipeline through a dedicated **Map Editor** effort.

#### Phase 1: Foundational Editing ✅

- ✅ In-engine edit mode toggle (runtime-safe authoring sandbox) — F2 key.
- ✅ Grid/snap controls and transform gizmos for placement — G key cycles position/rotation/scale.
- ✅ Placement of editor marker objects with grid-snapping — N key.
- ✅ Terrain sculpt and paint tools (chunk-level sculpt raise + paint tint pass in editor mode).

#### Phase 2: Content Authoring Workflows 🚧

- ✅ Multi-type entity placement: **marker**, **loot**, **NPC spawn**, **quest marker**, **structure** — T key cycles type.
- ✅ Visual differentiation by type: each placement type has a distinct mesh shape and colour.
- ✅ Patrol route authoring — P key starts a new NPC patrol group; NPC spawn points placed in the same group are connected by a visible route line.
- ✅ Map export to portable JSON — F4 key serializes all placed entities and patrol routes.
- ✅ Map import from JSON — re-creates editor entities from a previously exported layout.
- ✅ Place and configure structures, props, and spawn volumes with property panels — select any placed entity to open the in-editor property panel (label, loot table, spawn template, objective ID, dialogue trigger, structure ID).
- ✅ Quest marker and dialogue trigger placement helpers with linked objective IDs.

#### Phase 3: Data + Collaboration ✅

- ✅ Validation tooling baseline shipped (missing patrol refs, short patrol routes, overlap checks).
- ✅ Expand validation coverage (orphaned quest-marker hints, duplicate objectiveId detection, invalid cross-system references via optional context: loot tables, spawn templates, known objective IDs).
- ✅ Serialize maps to portable JSON/asset bundles — `exportToFile()` triggers a browser file download (F4 in editor mode).
- ✅ Import/export map packs for sharing and testing — `importFromFile(File)` and `importFromJson(string)` re-create a layout from disk; F6 in editor mode opens a file picker.

#### Phase 4: Production-Ready Pipeline

- ✅ **QuestCreatorSystem** — Headless quest-authoring layer: `setMeta()`, `addNode()`, `updateNode()`, `removeNode()`, `validate()` (via `QuestGraphEngine`), `toQuestDefinition()`, `exportToJson()` / `exportToFile()` (browser download), `importFromJson()` / `importFromFile()`. Orphaned-prerequisite pruning on `removeNode()`.
- ✅ **Quest Creator UI** — HTML overlay panel (`QuestCreatorUI`): quest metadata form (id / name / description / XP reward), live node list with per-node trigger type selector, target-ID and count inputs, description and prerequisites fields, validate / export-JSON / import-JSON / reset actions; opens/closes with **F10** (also dismissable with **Esc**).
- ✅ **FactionCreatorSystem** — Headless faction-authoring layer: `setMeta()` (id, name, description, defaultReputation, hostileBelow, friendlyAt, alliedAt), `addRelation()` / `updateRelation()` / `removeRelation()` for directed inter-faction relationship records, `validate()` (ordering checks, duplicate-target detection, self-reference guard), `toDefinition()` → `FactionDefinition` for `FactionEngine`, `exportToJson()` / `exportToFile()`, `importFromJson()` / `importFromFile()`.
- ✅ **Faction Creator UI** — HTML overlay panel (`FactionCreatorUI`): two-column layout (identity + reputation thresholds with live disposition preview bar), full relations list with per-row targetId / disposition / note fields; validate / export-JSON / import-JSON / reset actions; opens/closes with **Shift+F9** (also dismissable with **Esc**).
- ✅ **LootTableCreatorSystem** — Headless loot-table-authoring layer: `setMeta()` (id, rolls, unique, noneWeight), `addEntry()` / `updateEntry()` / `removeEntry()` / `moveEntryUp()` / `moveEntryDown()` for loot entries (itemId, itemName, weight, min/maxQuantity, guarantee, subTableId, minLevel/maxLevel conditions), `validate()`, `toLootTable()` → `LootTable` for `LootTableSystem`, `exportToJson()` / `exportToFile()`, `importFromJson()` / `importFromFile()`.
- ✅ **Loot Table Creator UI** — HTML overlay panel (`LootTableCreatorUI`): table-settings column (id, rolls, unique flag, none-weight) + scrollable entry list with per-entry itemId / itemName / subTableId / weight / quantity range / level conditions / guarantee; reorder-up/down per entry; validate / export-JSON / import-JSON / reset actions; opens/closes with **Shift+F8** (also dismissable with **Esc**).
- ✅ **EditorHub expanded** — Faction Creator and Loot Table Creator added to the F11 Editor Hub launcher grid alongside Map, Quest, Dialogue, NPC, and Item editors.
- ✅ **Map Editor UX improvements** — `MapEditorPalettePanel` (placement-palette browser with per-type description and quick-place button, bottom-left dock); `MapEditorValidationPanel` (dedicated scrollable validation results pane, toggled by F7, with re-validate and entity-focus actions); **D** key shortcut to duplicate the selected entity; toolbar extended with live undo/redo stack counters.
- 🧭 Layer-based editing (terrain, encounters, narrative, lighting).
- 🧭 Optional standalone editor shell for non-programmer content creators.

### Networking Exploration

- 🧭 Investigate co-op/multiplayer architecture feasibility.
- 🧭 Define authority model and synchronization boundaries.

## Contribution Focus

If you want to contribute now, high-impact areas are:

1. ~~Map editor Phase 2 completions: property panels for placed entities, terrain sculpting.~~ ✅ Complete
2. ~~Map editor Phase 3 expansion: richer validation rules and map-pack workflows.~~ ✅ Complete
3. Framework-first consolidation: wiring framework state as source-of-truth for demo systems.
4. ~~Quest/content authoring ergonomics.~~ ✅ Complete — `QuestCreatorSystem` + `QuestCreatorUI` (F10).
5. Save/load robustness and automated tests.

## Next Steps

### HorseSystem / Mount System ✅
Completed in SAVE_VERSION 19. Key deliverables:

- **Horse entity** — Dedicated `Horse` class (capsule mesh, dedicated physics body, separate `maxSpeed`/`stamina` pool).
- **Mounting / dismounting** — Interact with a horse to mount; dismount via `F` key or on entering combat.
- **Mounted movement** — While mounted, player movement is redirected to the horse; camera stays first-person.
- **Stable NPCs** — Innkeepers and stable merchants offer horse purchase (gold-gated, one horse at a time).
- **Saddlebag inventory** — Horse carries an additional carry-weight slot unlocked on purchase.
- **Save state** — SAVE_VERSION 19: horse position, health, and equipped saddlebag items persisted.

### Weapon Archetype Tuning Pass ✅
- ✅ Sword (Blade) — faster swing cadence (0.85× cooldown), lower stamina cost (0.80×), medium stagger (15% chance, 0.2 s).
- ✅ Axe (Blade) — slightly slower swing (1.15× cooldown, 1.10× cost), higher damage (1.20×), better armor pen (25%), low stagger (10%).
- ✅ Mace (Blunt) — slow swing (1.40× cooldown/cost), highest damage (1.45×), excellent armor pen (50%), high stagger (40% chance, 0.45 s).
- ✅ Bow (Marksman) — per-arrow `drawTimeMultiplier`: iron 1.0, steel 1.05, elven 0.90 (lighter/faster), daedric 1.25 (heavier/slower).
- ✅ Staff (Destruction) — Q KEYDOWN begins a charge (up to 1.5 s); Q KEYUP fires a scaled destruction blast (fire damage, always staggers, awards destruction XP).

### Content GUI — Release A (Dockable Editor Layout) ✅
- ✅ Dockable editor layout (`EditorLayout` headless class: `dock()`/`undock()`/`setVisible()`/`hideAll()`, `getPanelsBySide()`, `getLayoutSnapshot()`/`restoreLayoutSnapshot()` for persistence) — wired into `game.ts` for all 6 map editor panels (hierarchy, palette, layers, notes, properties, validation) with initial dock positions.
- ✅ Unified selection model (`EditorLayout.setSelection()`/`clearSelection()`/`isSelected()`/`onSelectionChanged`) shared by map entities, quest nodes, and dialogue nodes — `mapEditorSystem.onEntitySelectionChanged` now routes through `editorLayout.setSelection()` so all panels share a single source of truth.

### Content GUI — Release B (Content-Specific Editors) ✅
- ✅ **Quest Graph GUI** — `QuestCreatorNodeDraft` gains `x`/`y` canvas positions; `QuestCreatorUI` renders an SVG graph panel with prerequisite arrows between quest nodes.
- ✅ **Dialogue Tree GUI** — `DialogueCreatorUI` condition/effect editors (flag, faction, quest, item, skill checks; set_flag, faction_delta, emit_event, activate_quest, consume/give item effects) in expandable per-choice panels.
- ✅ **Loot + Spawn GUI** — `SpawnCreatorSystem` + `SpawnCreatorUI` (Shift+F11 / Editor Hub): archetype picker, loot table link, count/level range/respawn interval, inline validation hints, JSON export/import.
- ✅ **Shared SchemaFieldBuilder** (`src/ui/schema-field-builder.ts`) — generic labeled control factory (`text`/`number`/`checkbox`/`select`/`textarea`) consuming field descriptors; used by `SpawnCreatorUI`.

### Content GUI — Release C (Validation + Packaging Workflow) ✅
- ✅ **ContentBundleSystem** (`src/systems/content-bundle-system.ts`) — headless aggregation layer: `attach*()` methods register each creator system; `validate()` runs every attached system's validator and returns a unified `ContentBundleReport` (per-system `BundleSystemReport` with `valid`, `label`, and normalised `issues[]`); `buildBundle()` / `exportToJson()` / `exportToFile()` produce the full content bundle; `sortKeysDeep()` / `toNormalizedJson()` helpers ensure all exported JSON uses deterministic alphabetical key ordering; `getPlayFromHereConfig(id)` returns metadata for the quick-open "play from here" button.
- ✅ **ContentBundleUI** (`src/ui/content-bundle-ui.ts`) — HTML overlay (Shift+F7 / Editor Hub "📦 Content Bundle"): bundle metadata form (title, description, author); per-system diagnostic rows with pass/fail icons, issue counts, expandable issue lists, and "▶ Open" quick-open buttons; "Validate All" and "⬇ Export Bundle" action buttons; `onPlayFromHere` callback opens matching creator UI without re-navigating manually.
- ✅ **Editor Hub expanded** — "Content Bundle" tool card added to the F11 Editor Hub launcher grid (shortcut Shift+F7, indigo accent).
- ✅ **Keybinding** — Shift+F7 toggles `ContentBundleUI`; also listed in the F1 help overlay and the Editor Hub.
